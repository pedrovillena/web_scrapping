We don't really even bother talking about the tsunami of criminality, because there essentially is no federal law any more, but everyone knows that it would be restored if Democrats were ever allowed to win an election again.

>Klobuchar veered into broader political territory, citing a wave of threats and violence targeting lawmakers.

>**MAGA Republicans were much more likely than others (58.2 percent, 38.3 percent, 31.5 percent, 25.1 percent) to endorse violence** as usually or always justified to advance at least one of 17 specific political objectives, and they were more likely to endorse violence to advance eight of those 17 objectives considered individually. Examples include “to return Donald Trump to the presidency this year,” “to preserve an American way of life based on Western European traditions,” and “to stop illegal immigration.” They were more likely than others to predict that they would be “armed with a gun” (18.6 percent, 9.5 percent, 8.1 percent, 4.7 percent) and “carry a gun openly” (9.3 percent, 4 percent, 3.2 percent, 2.6 percent) in a situation where they considered political violence justified.

https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/whats_driving_political_violence_in_america
>With data from two different national surveys, **they found that 24 percent of Republicans and 17 percent of Democrats believe that it is acceptable to threaten public officials; among Republicans who believe that Trump should have won the 2020 election, support for violence jumped 10 points**.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9335287/#abstract2
>Across both datasets, we find that radical acts perpetrated by **individuals associated with left-wing causes are less likely to be violent**. 

https://ccjs.umd.edu/feature/umd-led-study-shows-disparities-violence-among-extremist-groups
>They found nearly no difference between the likelihood of an Islamist extremist and a right-wing extremist committing an act of violence; **the probability of a violent act of extremism in the United States being committed by a left-wing extremist was found to be 0.33, 0.61 by a right-wing extremist, and 0.62 by an Islamist extremist**.

>Consistent with findings at the U.S. level, **attacks by left-wing extremists are 45% less likely to result in fatalities when compared to attacks by right-wing extremists**.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/10/1-in-4-republicans-pro-political-violence/75142467007/

>**More than 1 in 4 Republicans and nearly 1 in 3 Republicans with a favorable view of former President Donald Trump say political violence is acceptable**, a new study found.

>The study from the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit research organization, found that while **only 1 in 6 Americans supports political violence, the numbers are much higher among Republicans than Democrats**.

>According to the survey, **27% of Republicans and 32% of Republicans with a favorable view of Trump agree that “patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.” Only 10% of independents and 8% of Democrats said the same**.

clashes with police, vandalism, looting, or other destructive activity.

>In the remaining 6%, it is not clear who instigated the violent or destructive activity. While some cases of
violence or looting have been provoked by demonstrators, other events have escalated as a result of ag-
gressive government action, intervention from right-wing groups or individual assailants, and car-ram-
ming attacks.

destructive over twice as often, or nearly 14% of the time.**

1nm2c8v,"There are a couple of pretty simple approaches. 

Number one is to make capital gains tax rates equal to income tax rates. This notion that the money you make on money is somehow different than income is inherently unfair and favors the wealthy tremendously. 

Number two is to focus more on corporate rates than personal ones. The biggest tax avoidance in the nation is corporate. We often see citations about how high tax rates were under Eisenhower but rarely do we see that specifically mentioned in regard to corporations. Individuals have natural limitations on how they can avoid taxation but companies can easily minimize their tax burden by putting excess profit to work within the company and taking it off the profit margin. Facilities, salaries, research and development are all reinvestment strategies that would help the company and the economy at large without necessarily increasing tax revenue massively. 

We think of the “fair share” terminology in individual terms but all of the richest people are only so wealthy because of their asset value as major shareholders in massive companies. By using tax policy to encourage reinvestment, those individuals would automatically be “worth” less but their companies would be making a more beneficial contribution to the economy on broad terms",1
1nm2c8v,"I think most people would like to see the wealthiest pay a greater share of their income in taxes than non wealthy people do. It would't bother me a bit to see earners pulling in more than $10 million annually, pay 80% of every dollar beyond the ten millionth one. If we're gong to have an economy where people can get as rich as Elon Musk, we have to have a way to capture some of that wealth in taxes. Right now to many of those dollars are off the table.",1
1nm2c8v,"The fairest possible tax would be one that reduces everyone's utility equally.  Due to the diminishing marginal utility of money, this would result in rich people paying more than poor people.

(Measuring utility directly is very hard, but our current progressive taxation system is an attempt to approximate this.)",1

A part of it has just been the campaign finance system, with AIPAC and related supporters wielding a far bit of power in primaries.

A part of this is also tied to the general atmosphere of Arab-phobia in the US, with Israel being seen as proper ""white"" westerners. 

Another part is a result of the holocaust industry building up good will for Israel as somehow being an answer to the holocaust that exonerates western nations for their past crimes against the Jewish people.  

And still some others like David Duke see Israel as a microcosm of what they want for the US: an acceptable ethnic supremacist state. They think, if Israel can get away with lebensraum and genocide today, why can't we?",0

On the national stage, leaders like Warren, Sanders, and Murphy are pushing back. At the state and regional level, people like Newsom, Pritzker, and Moore — along with countless Democratic mayors — are showing what real leadership looks like and setting examples for the rest of the country.

That’s what we need: strong voices at every level — national, statewide, and local — all working to protect our democracy. For me, the priority isn’t rallying behind one single “leader.” It’s recognizing that we already have a lot of leaders, and supporting all of them in this fight.",28
1nkroke,"I'd say the Democrats appear leaderless.

Obviously this far from a presidential election, there's no White House contender, who would naturally become the leader of the party.

So what you have is the legislature, led by Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, who appear to be hapless and feckless. I think there's a good chance Jeffries actually loses his seat to a primary challenger in the midterms (see, Eric Cantor).

There's Sanders, AOC and (to a much lesser extent) Crockett who are more in touch with the Democratic base but aren't in leadership roles, but actually seem to be willing to fight Trump in a way the actual leadership are squeamish of.

Finally, there's state governors. Newsom is the most obviously trying to step into a leadership role and getting the appropriate media coverage. Pritzker is the other obvious option - I think a lot of the reason Trump backed away from his ""confrontation"" with Chicago is feeding Pritzker a win that would give him a massive boost on the national stage.

But no-one is really there now, and that's part of the reason the Democratic party's popularity is so low. They might even do better by wheeling out Pelosi again, who could at least look like a leader.",37

Think through your day yesterday, everything you did from when you got up to when you went to bed. It was probably pretty easy. Now do that again but think *backwards,* starting from when you went to bed to when you woke up. It's doable but it takes more thought.

Your memories are organized as stories in your brain and stories feel more relatable to us. We can see ourselves in them, we can see people we know in them.

Statistics is interesting but you have to put a *face* on statistics for people to really resonate with them.

It's why hearing that 5,000 people died in such-and-such a catastrophe is bad but then you see a memorial for those people where someone set out 5,000 pairs of shoes and it hits a lot harder. 5,000 is numbers on a page or a screen - it's big but it's kind of abstract. Staring at 5,000 pairs of shoes knowing each one used to be a person is a lot more visceral for people.",20

1nkwxla,"I’d like to use a powerful storytelling concept from the movie 10,000 BC to illustrate how we assign meaning and importance to information, particularly, why some things stick with us while others are forgotten.

In the film, the character Tic’Tic tells a story to D’Leh, the young hero:

*“A good man draws a circle around himself and cares for those within, his woman, his children. Other men draw a larger circle and bring within their brothers and sisters. But some men have a great destiny. They must draw around themselves a circle that includes many, many more. Your father was one of those men. You must decide for yourself whether you are, as well.”*

This story resonates because it taps into something deeply human, we all draw mental ""circles"" around the people and things we care about. These circles define the emotional relevance of our memories and experiences.

In modern society, most people naturally draw larger circles, including family, close friends, and maybe a few others. Very few people draw circles large enough to encompass strangers, distant communities, or the world at large.

This is where storytelling becomes so powerful.

When we hear a statistic, our brain tends to treat it as abstract, unless it affects someone within our circle. It is treated with no more importance than the 10,000 other numbers surrounding us thoughout the average day.

But here’s the key, when we hear a story, our minds instinctively start casting roles. We imagine the characters, and without even realizing it, we paste familiar faces, people from our own lives, onto them. A mother in the story becomes our mother. A struggling child becomes someone we know. This mental substitution brings the story into our circle, and with that, it gains emotional importance.

That’s why stories are remembered when statistics are not. They move from the abstract to the personal. They resonate emotionally. They stick.",3
1nkwxla,"Statistics is impersonal, and in a way dehumanizes the population it describes. It's almost like the larger the number casualties there are, the more likely we are to feel nothing at all (Gaza?). As if we have passed the limit of empathy, and we just feel very little.

Anecdotes and personal stories are things that people can relate to. They can attempt share in the experience. The narrow scope of the story leaves plenty of room for empathy to kick in. Adding more casualties to the story is not as significant as adding emotive details. COVID victim in their deathbed while their toddler holds their hand is worth more politically than a news report that cites 100 deaths due to COVID.

The result of this nonsense is that policy tends to be driven by anecdotes that get emotional responses rather than more meaningful population statistics and trends. Because politicians need votes and people are dumb and vote with their hearts rather than their brains.

Ultimately, this is a Critical Thinking issue (particularly availability bias). Which makes it an education issue. Which means we are probably doomed.",2

What we are seeing is the incompatibility between modern social media and our own threat response.

People are too easily riled up by a deluge of anecdotes, and the scale of our current society means that such anecdotes can easily be found. And the addictiveness of outrage is a drug our media depends on.

We aren't seeing roving tribes conquering territory. We are seeing a remarkable era of peace, with individual families moving and largely adapting to new cultures in ways that weren't possible ever before. 

Global transit and connectivity are incredibly new to our species. We aren't adapted for them at all. Our biology is still wired like it was half a million years ago. Our immune systems now create allergies because they are overactive; it was prepared to deal with a constant barrage of threats that we've now eliminated and now sees ghosts when threats are scarce.

With that in mind, I think we need to come to terms with the fact that those goals can be undermined by conversational bias rather than only censorship. This happens when our communication systems heavily bias certain groups over others. There's very little difference between a group being censored with 0% reach and being disfavored with 0.01% reach.

All of this talk of using him as some model nationally just has me scratching my head",34
1njie1b,"Three polls came out within a few days of each other last week on the Mayor's race here in NYC- all showed pretty much the same thing:  Mamdani with 46-48%; Cuomo 26-28%; Sliwa 15-18%; Adams 8-11%.

With early voting starting in about a month, he is firmly in control.  The 18-34 year old cohort is absolutely excited beyond words about him.  I'm a retired high school teacher and I keep in touch with a number of former students (now aged 25 to 57!)- some in real life, some via social media (mostly Instagram) and they are solidly behind him...and these are people from Staten Island....the most red part of the city, by a light year or two.

They are sick of housing costs- they want their own places, but have a hard time affording it.  They want better mass transit- and yes, they know the MTA is a state authority, but the Mayor does have influence.  The list goes on.

A couple of Sundays back, Mamdani's campaign held a five borough scavenger hunt.  It took a few hours to travel between all the boroughs, but several THOUSAND people turned out on about 36 hours notice to take part.  The activity itself didn't bring any new ideas, but it was brilliant.  The people taking part, mostly younger, felt a part of the campaign.  At 33 Mamdani is one of them.

All the bluster from the right, and from the other candidates- he's Muslim, he's a socialist, he too young, his ideas are radical- are mostly falling on deaf ears because he breaks the status quo, and all the accusations are the same old crap that everyone has heard for decades now.   Even FDR was called a communist and socialist.  You'd think after 95 years, it would just stop.

So the short answer to the OP's question is a resounding yes.  Sure, there are younger voters who are much more conservative and they'll vote for Sliwa or Cuomo.  But they are the minority as the polls show.

One more thing:  If he wins, I believe it will have national implications.  Not in a policy sense as much, but it might finally light a fire in the vast majority of younger people who do not vote, especially on the left.",7

Legally speaking, all those planes Russia has were stolen. If any of them show up in most airports in the world, they will be impounded and returned to their rightful owners. Until then, no airline parts supplier will authorize spare parts for those aircraft. Sanctions have nothing to do with it.

As far as removal of restrictions on Belavia, that might result in new aircraft being purchaseable by them. However, it's very likely that those purchases would have to be cash up front, and Belavia doesn't exactly have a lot of options for where to get cash. So chances are this makes very little difference.

The fact is, a lot of companies that stopped doing business with Russia, weren't forced to by sanctions. For example, a number of years back Russian malware caused a couple of billion dollars worth of damage to Maersk. (The one quoted figure I've seen in the news didn't include operational losses, so it's severely low).

1nlob1a,">My observations on the 🇷🇺 fuel market

>🔶 Gasoline

>Before the gubernatorial elections, which took place on Sept 12-14, in my opinion, they kept prices down using administrative measures, plus volumes from some reserves were being sold and traded on the exchange.

>Perhaps from state reserves. After the elections, sales from the reserves were closed. Gasoline sales on the exchange have been 25% below the August average for the third day running, which is about 7,000 tons per day lost. Prices aren't rising because they're being held down administratively. But the shortage has begun to grow. This is especially true in regions where independent gas stations operate. There are no vertically integrated oil companies there.

>In Russia, 67% of gas stations are independent, and they sell 27% of the total.

>🔷 Diesel

>In the past month, diesel fuel prices on the exchange have increased by 15%, from 58,000 rubles per ton to 68,800 rubles today. And now the time is coming when independent gas stations will be screwed. They have no profit from gasoline; they used to make money from diesel, but now that too will disappear. And then independent gas stations will be forced to either go into the red and close, or charge exorbitant prices for the fuel they can sell. But this will also cause a backlash and administrative pressure.

>Ru problem is its size. Vertically integrated oil companies (VIOCs) have gas stations only in large cities and along federal highways. There are none in rural areas. It's a stalemate. It's impossible to close independent gas stations because it would paralyze the entire rural area.

>There are several regions where there are no VIOCs at all. For example, Dagestan. Gas there has long been 20% more expensive than Moscow and the prices at VIOC gas stations. In summary, I believe the situation will accelerate!
